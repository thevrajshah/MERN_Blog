# Personal Portfolio

This branch of the project reflects my journey of learning React & programming paradigms in general. You might find a lot of clumsy & unplanned code as all of it was just my trying different things. However, the UI design is one thing I'm proud of; though it was a 100% incremental design it turned out pretty well for me at that point atleast. Also, the design has never gone through a figma/XD project, I just took inspirations from different places & simply applied them to the project.

This started coming together as soon as I started learning ReactJS and eventually grew into what it is now. I don't know if someone can make out but it originated from the 21DaysChallenge website that I built earlier.
